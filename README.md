## Branching Strategy

- `main`: Stable, portfolio-ready version of the project.
- `kuro`: Development and Azure Data Factory collaboration branch used to build and test incremental pipelines.
- `adf_publish`: Reserved for Azure Data Factory publish artifacts. Intentionally kept empty for this portfolio project.
